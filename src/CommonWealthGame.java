//Q. The 2022 Commonwealth Games, officially known as the XXII Commonwealth Games and commonly known
// as Birmingham 2022 are about to start. To help sports commentators determine in real time how countries are doing,
// the list of gold medals won by each country was originally saved in an array of countries and an array of medals separately.
// To simplify implementation, information has to be transferred from the existing arrays into a linked list.
// Write a Java method to transfer country and gold medal data from the arrays
// into a linked list with all elements in the same order
